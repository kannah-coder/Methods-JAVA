# Methods-JAVA

A method in Java is a block of code inside a class that performs a specific task, and can be called (invoked) when needed.
It helps achieve:
Code reusability
Modularity
Readability
Encapsulation (keeping logic inside the class)

# ⚙️ Method Overloading in Java (Advanced Example)

This project demonstrates **Method Overloading** in Java with multiple complex cases — covering data type variations, varargs, and type promotions.

---

## 🧩 **Code Explanation**

### 🔹 `MathOperations` Class
This class defines multiple **overloaded `add()` methods**, each handling different types or numbers of arguments.

#### ✅ Types of Overloading Demonstrated
| Method Signature | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `int add(int, int)` | Adds two integers |
| `double add(double, double)` | Adds two doubles |
| `int add(int, int, int)` | Adds three integers |
| `int add(int... numbers)` | Adds any number of integers using varargs |
| `String add(String, String)` | Concatenates two strings |
| `double add(long, float)` | Demonstrates type promotion |

MethodsShowcase.java is a Java program demonstrating a variety of methods in a single file. It covers:

Instance methods
Method overloading
Recursion
Methods with arrays
Varargs (variable number of arguments)
Private methods
Methods calling other methods

This program is designed as a learning reference for Java beginners to understand different ways to write and use methods.
